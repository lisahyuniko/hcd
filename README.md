# hcd analysis


**Summary**


  The goal of this assignment was to sort subway and starbucks locations and find which zip code area has more branch. I wanted to see which area has more starbucks and subway than other areas- especially near where I live: Austin, Texas. I made bar graphs for both starbucks and subway- to see which zip code area has more branch. After analyzing this dataset, I was able to visualize dataset with making a bar graphs.
